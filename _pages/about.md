I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Intelligent Systems (INSY) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (EEMCS). 

My research focuses on developing machine and deep learning techniques to tackle climate challenges and address geophysical problems, especially by informing physics or domain knowledge to improve the AI model’s reliability and interpretability. 

My work spans a broad spectrum of geophysical aspects, such as seismic, magnetic, and electromagnetic techniques, which are crucial for understanding the Earth's subsurface structures and physical properties. I also work on utilizing satellite-based observations to understand the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and oceans.
