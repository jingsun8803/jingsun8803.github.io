I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Intelligent Systems (INSY) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (EEMCS). My research focuses on developing machine and deep learning techniques to tackle climate challenges and address geophysical problems, especially by informing physics or domain knowledge to improve the AI modelâ€™s reliability and interpretability. My work spans a broad spectrum of geophysical aspects, such as seismic, magnetic, and electromagnetic techniques, which are crucial for understanding the Earth's subsurface structures and physical properties. I also work on utilizing satellite-based observations to understand the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and oceans.

I obtained my M.S. and B.S. degrees in geophysics from Jilin University, China. Before joining TU Delft, I had close to 5 years of experience working in the energy industry, first as an industrial PhD researcher on deep learning for marine seismic processing at CGG and the University of Oslo, Norway, and then as a Research Geophysicist at Shearwater GeoServices in the UK. Building on this foundation, my research interest also lies in AI-based solutions to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources, including the assessment and monitoring of offshore wind farms.
